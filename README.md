### What is this?

48hr.email is my very own tempmail service. You can create emails on the fly with one click, not needing to worry about corporations do with your email. They can sell that one all they want!

All data is being removed 48hrs after they have reached the mail server.

### What are its features?

- Create a custom inbox with select name and domain, or get a fully randomized one
- Receive emails with a clean preview in your inbox, with optional browser notifications
- Read emails, with support for CSS & JS just like you are used to from regular email providers
- Delete your emails ahead of time by pressing the delete button

### How does this work?

48hr.email uses an existing IMAP server for its handling. A single catch-all account and the accompanying credentials handle all the emails.

<p>Since I work full-time on open-source projects spread across my organizations, my only source of income is donations from people like you that use & appreciate my stuff. So, if you can spare a dollar or two, I would really appreciate that. All the money goes towards paying rent, essentials like food, drinks etc, and most importantly it will be used to fuel my cookie addictionüç™<br></p>
